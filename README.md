# COVEN

Coven is a decentralized social network application built on the Lens Protocol. Content creators on Coven are in complete control of their data and each user profile is a Non-Fungible Token (NFT).

Unlike most other decentralized social network applications, Coven hopes to implement "Engagement Rewards" to users who engage with creator's contents within the "Acceptable Reward Criteria". When users engage with posts and comments, users get to decide the payout of those posts. This way, quality content creation is rewarded by other users.

Coven leverages and customizes the Lens Protocol's social graph.

## Creating a profile on the Lens Protocol is currently gated, however other creators' posts can be seen and appreciated.

## Problem Statement

- Corporate entities control major social media sites, and a small group of people within these companies sets the rules of engagement.
- This has raised concerns about free speech and censorship among users.
- Invasive advertising by centralized networks and the risk to privacy.

## Our Solution

- Coven is a A decentralized social network built on top of the Lens Protocol which gives users more control.
- This application is censorship resistant, gives ownership to users over personal data, and improved control over user-generated content.
- Instead of invasive advertisement, Covven promotes new forms of monetization to manage liquidity pool for incentivization.
