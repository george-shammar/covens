# COVEN

### Coven is a decentralized social network application built on the Lens Protocol. Content creators on Coven are in complete control of their data and each user profile is a Non-Fungible Token (NFT).

### Unlike most other decentralized social network applications, Coven hopes to implement "Engagement Rewards" to users who engage with creator's contents within the "Acceptable Reward Criteria". When users engage with posts and comments, users get to decide the payout of those posts. This way, quality content creation is rewarded by other users.

### The economic model and the tokenomics of Coven is being designed for a sustainable reward mechanism. Coven leverages and customizes the Lens Protocol's social graph.
